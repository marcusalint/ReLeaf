# Releaf

Releaf is a single-paged crowdfunding application for natural disaster victims built with React and React-Router. Express was used for the backend and Stripe API to process the client's credit card payments. The front-end was styled with Material-UI and SASS. Releaf is a final project created by Salar Taeb, Sahil Sharma, and Samantha Fok.

Users can create a campaign and set a donation goal. The goal is broken down into products of what the donation money will be funding. The campaign can be searched from a search page by the user's name or location.
